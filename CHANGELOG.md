## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- `*_and_log` / `log` no longer raise Ecto.ConstraintError on duplicate audit_log pkey (audit_logs_pkey / audit_log_pkey). Declares unique_constraint so violations become soft errors. Closes OPS-4599.

### Fixed

- `*_and_log/*` and `log/*` no longer raise a `:rollback` `RuntimeError` when called from inside an `Ecto.Multi`. Closes OPS-3479.
