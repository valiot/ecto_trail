## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- `unique_constraint` declared on the audit-log primary key (table_name || "audit_log" + "_pkey") inside `changelog_changeset` so that `Ecto.ConstraintError` on `audit_logs_pkey` (or equivalent) during `*_and_log` / `log_changes` becomes a changeset error instead of crashing the caller. Closes OPS-4587.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- `*_and_log/*` and `log/*` no longer raise a `:rollback` `RuntimeError` when called from inside an `Ecto.Multi`. Closes OPS-3479.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-04-07

### Changed

- Refactor for performance and idiomatic Elixir (see git history).

## [Unreleased / prior]

See git log for earlier history (original author Nebo15 / Valiot).
